# PythonParser
This program traces python files in certain formats in order to return the Big-O complexity of various code blocks as well as the entire file.
This is accomplished with the use of stacks in order to enter and leave blocks of code and keep track of each code block's respective Big-O complexity.
The Big-O complexity of each python file can only be in the form O(n^x + log(n)^y).
